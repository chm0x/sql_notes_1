# SQL as a DECLARATIVE LANGUAGE

SQL is the programming language you need to execute commands that let you create and manipulate a relational database. 

TYPES OF PROGRAMMING:

1. Procedural (imperative).
2. Object-oriented. 
3. Declarative
4. Functional

SQL is mainly regarded as a **DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**.

In short, while you coding you will not be interested in **how** you want the job done. 
The focus is on **what** results you want to obtain. 

Main component of SQL's syntax:

- Data Definition Language (DDL).
- Data Manipulation Language (DML).
- Data Control Language (DCL).
- Transaction Control Language (TCL).
