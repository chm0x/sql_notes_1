-- LAG() and LEAD() Value Window Functions 

/*
    As opposed to ranking window functions, value window
    functions *return a value that can be found in the database*.

    LAG: 
        - Returns the value from a specified field of a record that 
        precedes the current row. 

    LEAD:
        - Returns the value from a specified field of a record that
        follows *(the value that leads the current value) the current row.

*/

/*  
    USE CASES:
        - The salary values from all contract that employee 10001 had
        ever signed while working for the company(in ascending order).
        - A column showing the PREVIOUS salary value from our ordered list.
        - A column showing the NEXT salary value from our ordered list. 
        - A column displaying the DIFFERENCE between the CURRENT and PREVIOUS salary
        of a given record from the list. 
        - A column displaying the DIFFERENCE between the NEXT and the CURRENT salary 
        of a given record from the list.

-- EXERCISE 1
/*
    Write a query that can extract the following information 
    from the "employees" database:

    - the salary values (in ascending order) of the contracts 
    signed by all employees numbered between 10500 and 10600 inclusive

    - a column showing the previous salary from the given ordered list

    - a column showing the subsequent salary from the given ordered list

    - a column displaying the difference between the current salary 
    of a certain employee and their previous salary

    - a column displaying the difference between the next salary 
    of a certain employee and their current salary

    Limit the output to salary values higher than $80,000 only.

    Also, to obtain a meaningful result, partition the data by employee number.

-- EXERCISE 2
/*
    The MySQL LAG() and LEAD() value window functions can have a second argument, 
    designating how many rows/steps back (for LAG()) or 
    forth (for LEAD()) we'd like to refer to with respect to a given record.

    With that in mind, create a query whose result set contains 
    data arranged by the salary values associated to each employee 
    number (in ascending order).
    Let the output contain the following six columns:

    - the employee number

    - the salary value of an employee's contract 
    (i.e. which weâ€™ll consider as the employee's current salary)

    - the employee's previous salary

    - the employee's contract salary value preceding their previous salary

    - the employee's next salary

    - the employee's contract salary value subsequent to their next salary
